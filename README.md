Log Helper
=============

Log Helper is a small [Instantbird](http://www.instantbird.com) extension which adds a few additional features to the current log viewer.

Features
-------

The features currently added by this extension can be found by right clicking the list of log files in the log viewer.

* **Open JSON:** Opens the text contents of the log in the default text editor.
* **Delete Log:** Removes the currently selected log file from disk.
* **Open Main Logs Directory:** Opens the folder where Instantbird is storing your logs.
* **Open Directory of Current Log:** Opens the folder of the currently viewed log.

Future
-----

This was a small project to further familiarize myself with Instantbird. I hope to continue work on this addon in the future!
